			<h3>Then Toto came up, and immediately began to bark</h3>

				<p>The Lion climbed the ladder next, and the Tin Woodman came last; but both of them cried, "Oh, my!" as soon as they looked over the wall. When they were all sitting in a row on the top of the wall, they looked down and saw a strange sight.</p>

				<p>Before them was a great stretch of country having a floor as smooth and shining and white as the bottom of a big platter.  Scattered around were many houses made entirely of china and painted in the brightest colors.  These houses were quite small, the biggest of them reaching only as high as Dorothy's waist.  There were also pretty little barns, with china fences around them; and many cows and sheep and horses and pigs and chickens, all made of china, were standing about in groups.</p>
